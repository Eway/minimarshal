# MiniMarshal

A versatile tagging and categorization system, in a single PHP file.

**The following is wrong as of most of the life of this project!!!** However, I have not updated it yet. PLEASE IGNORE THE FOLLOWING!

To use:

1. Copy minimarshal.php to your website
2. Use `require_once('path/to/minimarshal.php')` on any page you want to access tag / category data from
3. There is no step 3.
