# Contributing

If you're thinking of contributing to MiniMarshal, that's great! Feel free to fork and pull request if you'd like to help with MiniMarshal's development. Just keep in mind the following:

- New features are likely to be rejected at this point, unless they're very minor or on the todo list below. MiniMarshal is currently in very early stages of development, so I'm going to be very tentative in terms of merging entirely new features.
- Please try to conform to the existing code style as much as possible. There's no definitive style guide yet, but, for example, putting your open braces on new lines instead of on the same line is likely to get your PR rejected. (I'll be fairly lenient on this one, though.)
- Large bodies of code are also probably not going to be merged to master -- if you're thinking of doing something major, please check via opening an issue on Github first.

# TODO

- Pagniation
- Markdown in data/descriptions
- Comment system (and review)
